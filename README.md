# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis - Tableau Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes hotel booking data to uncover insights that can help hotel managers understand customer behavior, improve occupancy rates, and identify patterns in cancellations, seasonal trends, and customer preferences.

The analysis was performed using **Tableau**, a powerful data visualization tool, and is based on a real-world dataset containing booking records for two types of hotels: **City Hotel** and **Resort Hotel**.
